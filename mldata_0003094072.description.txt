
DESCRIPTON
----------

This dataset is composed of 1200 samples with 35 features each. The first column
is the sample id. The second column in the dataset represents the label. There
are 5 possible values for the labels. The remaining columns are numeric
features.

Your task is the following: assuming that you want to classify this data with
Logistic Regression (implemented by sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression),
you should determine whether applying PCA to this dataset is useful, and if so
what number of components you would choose to use. At the end of the analysis,
you should have chosen an optimal strategy, including the optimal set of
parameters for the classifier: write this choice explicitly in the conclusions
of your notebook.

Your notebook should detail the procedure you have used to choose the optimal
parameters (graphs are a good idea when possible/sensible).

The notebook will be evaluated not only based on the final results, but also on
the procedure employed, which should balance practical considerations (one may
not be able to exhaustively explore all possible combinations of the parameters)
with the desire for achieving the best possible performance in the least amount
of time.

Bonus points may be assigned for particularly clean/nifty code and/or well-
presented results.

You are also free to attempt other strategies beyond the one in the assignment
(which however is mandatory!).
